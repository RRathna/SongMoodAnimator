# SongMoodAnimator
Draws colorful pictures to the mood of the song as it plays - happy/sad/neutral

The song and the lyrics have to be saved in the same folder as the code. The file names have to be "sound.wav" and lyrics.txt" respectively.
Each paragraph in the lyrics needs to be separated by a newline.
The song file has to be of .wav format.
Running the run.py file will create a turtle window and simultaneously play the song.

The dictionary.txt acts as the reference from which the emotion of a paragraph is calculated. It is an essential part of the project and needs to kept in the same folder as run.py



Improvement points:
Since the project was submitted within a week's notice, it lacks more images to draw and emotions are restricted.
The sentiment analysis applied is very crude and requires major improvements.
